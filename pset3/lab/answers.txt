sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Comparing the real time of sorting random values and sorted value, we can see a huge time difference between them. This proves the worst case scenerio of bubble sort is very high compared to the best case scenerio of bubble sort.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: We know merge sort is much faster than both selection sort and bubble sort, which is proved using random values. Also the random, reversed and sorted values hae similar run time, confirming of merge sort.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Selection sort provided similar run time for all types value alike merge sort but it took more time than that of merge sort. So, it is confirmed than selection sort is used.
